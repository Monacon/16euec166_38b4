                                      PREVENTION OF FOOD ADULTERATION USING NIR SPECTROSCOPY AND MONITORING USING IoT.

Short Description of our Project:

As the 20th century ends the world population approaches 6 billion people and is expected to increase to 8 billion by the year 2020. It is the responsibility of agriculture to provide food for all these people. Application of existing technology and innovation of new technology will be essential if agricultural scientists are to achieve this enormous task. At present, NIR spectroscopy has made major contributions to food production, and to the assessment of food quality and potential end-uses of produce. As budding engineers we must strive to make contributions which help agriculture meet the challenge to feed and nourish the people of the world. The major challenge persisting in agriculture today is maintaining sustainable yields, whilst reducing people getting affected with prolonged food borne diseases. To have the greatest impact NIR-based technologies along IoT must be used to prevent the consumption of trashy food products in our daily lives. It is done by scanning the food items externally, we can fix the problem inside it using wavelength reflected by those food items as part of NIR rays. That information are stored in database. These challenges will involve developing and promoting options that are acceptable politically, sociologically and economically. Hence the automated NIR technology which can be accessed using android app being developed will provide the greatest benefits to feeding and nourishing the world's people if there is closer interaction with plant breeders, agronomists, environmentalists, food processors and marketers. And that app is user friendly and easy to access even to uneducated people also. This app fetches data from database where information of food items was stored. By storing in database, it enable user to refer previous data of food whenever needed. Existing methods have only conventional manual methods but this technology is automated and doesn’t need sample preparation. This method is time efficient and user can get result in instant of time.
